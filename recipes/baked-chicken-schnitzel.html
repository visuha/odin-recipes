 <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Chicken schnitzel is a breeze to make in the oven. Plus, this method uses less oil and has easier cleanup.<br> 
    The breaded chicken breasts are baked until golden and crispy on the outside, yet they're still tender and juicy on the inside. Serve schnitzels with lemon wedges and a German-style potato salad.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</li>
     <li>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)</li>
     <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
     <li>Â¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
     <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
     <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
     <li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
     <li>1 large lemon, zested</li>
   </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with<br> 
      aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil.Place the baking sheet in the oven as it preheats.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a solid, level surface. 
      <br>Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to 1/4-inch thickness. Season both sides<br> 
      with salt and pepper.</li>  
    <li>Mix flour and paprika together in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper together in a<br>
      second shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and lemon zest together in a third shallow bowl.</li>
    <li>Dredge one piece of chicken in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg.<br> 
      Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides.<br>
      Place the breaded chicken, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
    <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange chicken in a single layer on the hot sheet.<br>
      Drizzle more olive oil over each piece.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until<br>
      no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes more.<br>
      An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>      
    </ol>
