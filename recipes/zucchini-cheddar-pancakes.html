 <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Six simple ingredients come together for a deliciously savory zucchini pancake, 
    featuring Cheddar cheese and onions mixed into the batter.<br> 
    You can jazz these up however you'd like; some reviewers suggest marinara sauce 
    for dipping, while others added garlic.
